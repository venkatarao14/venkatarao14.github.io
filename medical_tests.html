  <h2>Health screenings for men age 65 and older</h2>

  <p>

  Even if you feel fine, you should  see your doctor for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. 
  For example, the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and high cholesterol levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages.
   A simple blood test can check for these conditions.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Screen for medical issues</li>
    <li>Assess your risk for future medical problems</li>
    <li>Encourage a healthy lifestyle</li>
    <li>Update on  preventive care services</li>
