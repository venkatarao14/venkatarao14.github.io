		<H1> Golden Era </H1>
		<p>Welcome to the golden era of your life. By the age 60, you have completed most of the responsibilities of your family.
Now it is time to relax, rejuvenate and enjoy the post-retirement life. 
You got a great freedom to do whatever you want.
 Wake up at your own flexible time  and enjoy your choice of breakfast .  Full day is at your disposal !
  Spend time with your grandchildren, go for a walk, read books, watch movies, listen to music, do gardening, go for a vacation.
