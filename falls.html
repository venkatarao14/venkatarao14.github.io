  <H1> Falls and Fracture in older adults </H1>

  <p> A simple accident like tripping on a rug or slipping on a wet floor can change your life. If you fall, you could
    break a bone, which thousands of older adults experience each year. For older people, a broken bone can also be the
    start of more serious health problems and can lead to long-term disability.More than one in four people age 65 years
    or older fall each year. The risk of falling — and fall-related problems — rises with age. </p>



  <H1>What causes falls in older adults?</H1>

  <p>

    Many things can cause a fall.

  <ul>
    <li>eyesight</li>
    <li>hearing</li>
    <li>reflexes </li>
    <li>Balance related issues:</li>
    Diabetes, heart disease, thyroid, nerves, feet, or blood vessels can affect the balance.
  </ul>

</p>

  <p>

    Age-related loss of muscle mass (known as sarcopenia), problems with balance and gait, and blood pressure that drops
    too much when you get up from lying down or sitting (called postural hypotension) are all risk factors for falling.
    Foot problems that cause pain, and unsafe footwear such as backless shoes or high heels, can also increase your risk
    of falling.
    Some medications can increase a person’s risk of falling because they cause side effects such as dizziness or
    confusion. The more medications you take, the more likely you are to fall.
    Safety hazards in the home or community environment can also cause falls.
  </p>

  <p>Sarcopenia is defined as a decline in muscle mass, strength, and function. It is often associated with older
    adults, but some forms of sarcopenia can also affect middle-aged people. Sarcopenia has been connected to weakness;
    fatigue; lower energy levels; and difficulty standing, walking, and climbing stairs. Sarcopenia is more likely to
    occur in people with chronic diseases and may contribute to a risk of falls, fractures, other serious injuries, and
    premature mortality. </p>

  <H1>Steps to take to prevent falls</H1>
  If you take care of your overall health, you may have a lower chance of falling. Most of the time, falls and accidents
  don’t just happen for no reason. Here are a few tips to help lessen your risk of falls and broken bones, also known as
  fractures:

  Six Tips To Help Prevent Falls infographic.

  <li>Stay physically active. Plan an exercise program that is right for you. Regular exercise improves muscles and
    makes you stronger. Exercise also helps keep your joints, tendons, and ligaments flexible. Mild weight-bearing
    activities, such as walking or climbing stairs, may slow bone loss from osteoporosis, a disease that makes bones
    weak and more likely to break</li>

  <li>Try balance and strength training exercises. Yoga, Pilates, and tai chi can all improve balance and muscle
    strength. You can also try lifting weights or using resistance bands to build strength. Learn more about different
    types of exercises to improve balance and strength.</li>
  <li>Fall-proof your home. Check out these tips for changes you can make to your home that will help you avoid falls
    and ensure your safety.</li>
  <li>Have your eyes and hearing tested. Even small changes in sight and hearing are linked to an increased risk for
    falls. When you get new eyeglasses or contact lenses, take time to get used to them. Wear your glasses or contacts
    as your eye doctor advises. If you have a hearing aid, be sure it fits well and wear it.</li>
  <li>Find out about the side effects of any medicines you take. If a drug makes you sleepy or dizzy, tell your doctor
    or pharmacist.
    Get enough sleep. If you are tired, you are more likely to fall.</li>
  <li>Avoid or limit alcohol. Too much alcohol can lead to balance problems and falls, which can result in hip or arm
    fractures and other injuries.</li>
  <li>Stand up slowly. Getting up too quickly can cause your blood pressure to drop. That can make you feel wobbly. Get
    your blood pressure checked when lying and standing.</li>

  <li>Keep your hands free. Use a shoulder bag, fanny pack, or backpack to leave your hands free to hold on to railings.
    Choose the right footwear. To fully support your feet, wear nonskid, rubber-soled, low-heeled shoes. Don’t walk on
    stairs or floors in socks or in shoes and slippers with smooth soles.</li>

  <H1>What to do if you fall</H1>
  <li>Whether you are at home or somewhere else, a sudden fall can be startling and upsetting. If you do fall, stay as
    calm as possible and take the following steps:</li>

  <a>
    <li>Breathe. Take several deep breaths to try to relax. Remain still on the floor or ground for a few moments. This
      will help you get over the shock of falling.,
  </a></li>

  <a>
    <li>Decide if you are hurt. Getting up too quickly or in the wrong way could make an injury worse.
  </a></li>

  <a>
    <li>Crawl to a sturdy chair. If you think you can get up safely without help, roll over onto your side. Rest again
      while your body and blood pressure adjust. Slowly get up on your hands and knees, and crawl to a sturdy chair.
