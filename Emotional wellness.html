		<H1> Emotions </H1>
			<p>Emotions are conscious mental reactions (such as anger or fear) subjectively
	experienced as strong feelings usually directed toward a specific object and
	typically accompanied by physiological and behavioral changes in the body.</p>
	<p> At every stage of life, we have emotional needs that must be fulfilled in order for
	us to feel truly happy and healthy. As you age, your emotional needs and the way
	you meet those needs may change. 
	How you react to your experiences and feelings can
	change over time.How you feel can 
	affect your ability to carry out everyday activities, your relationships,
	and your overall mental health. </p>
	 <p>Emotional wellness is the ability to successfully handle life’s
	stresses and adapt to change and difficult times. People who are emotionally well,
	experts say, have fewer negative emotions and are able to bounce back from
	difficulties faster. This quality is called resilience.

	Develop healthy physical habits.Healthy eating, physical activity, and regular
sleep can improve your physical and mental health. </p>

 <p>If you have an aging loved one, you can
take active steps to ensure that their emotional needs are fulfilled.</p>



	 <H3>What Are the Emotional Needs of Seniors?</H3>
Please note that even small actions on your part can help your senior loved one feel
valued, appreciated, and understood.
	 <p>seniors have different values and priorities, so the needs of your loved one
 may not be exactly the same as the needs of another individual. However, there are
 some core needs that virtually all older adults lean on. The following are a few
 examples:



 <p><li>Social interaction.</li> 
 <li>Meaningful relationships.</li> 
 <li>Safety. </li>
 <li>Belonging.</li> 
 <li>Meaning and purpose.</li>
 <li> Empathy and validation.</li> 
  <li>Independence and autonomy.</li> 
  <li>Privacy.</li> 
  
  Here Are Seven Ways to Meet the Emotional and Mental Health Needs of Older Adults


	<h5>1. Actively Listen</h5>


	<p>Everyone needs to feel seen, heard, and understood by those around them.
Unfortunately, many people disregard seniors’ opinions and don’t truly listen to what
they’re saying when they speak. One of the best things you can do for your aging loved
one is to actively listen to them.



	When they talk, your only job is to hear and understand what they say. You don’t
need to be thinking of a response or a follow-up question as they’re speaking.
Instead, dedicate your full attention to them. When the individual knows that you’re
listening intently, they’ll feel a stronger sense of connection to you, and they’ll
feel more fulfilled by the conversation.</p>



	<h5>2. Prioritize Safety and Security</h5>


	<p>Safety is one of the most basic but important needs for seniors. If your loved one
doesn’t feel safe and secure, they probably won’t have the emotional energy to fulfill
their other needs.



	You can help to ensure your loved one’s safety by identifying and removing
physical risks in their environment. There are a number of home modifications you can
install to allow them to navigate their home more safely. Security systems, new locks,
and emergency call buttons can all help seniors feel at peace in their homes, too.



	<h5>3. Respect Their Wishes</h5>


	 <p>Seniors  have the ability and the right to advocate for themselves. People sometimes infantilize
older adults, treating them as if they’re young children who cannot make their own
decisions. However, seniors can and should be in control of their own lives. You can
show your loved one that they’re valued and respected by actively listening to their
wants and needs and doing your best to meet them.



	<h5>4. Find Meaningful Activities</h5>


	<p>Recreation is a major component of mental health and emotional wellness in
seniors. Hobbies provide an opportunity for self-expression and a sense of pride and
fulfillment in one’s work. Some seniors may struggle to find meaningful activities on
their own, though. You can help your senior loved one by suggesting activities that
you can do together. Not only does this give them a chance to participate in fun
hobbies, but it can also be a social outlet.



	<h5>5. Socialize</h5>


	<p>In many cases, lack of socialization drives the emotional changes in seniors as
they age. When you get older, you may not find as many opportunities to connect with
others throughout your day-to-day life. Retirement, mobility limitations, and the loss
of friends or a spouse can all contribute to loneliness and isolation in older adults.



	Social interaction is absolutely necessary for people of all ages to feel well.
Even introverted seniors need to connect with others from time to time, so you should
make sure that your loved one has regular opportunities to spend time with others.



	<h5>6. Assist With Self-care</h5>


	<p>Hygiene, grooming, and other self-care tasks can become more difficult with age.
While some seniors have no problem keeping up with their self-care, others may see
their chronic pain or mobility issues get in the way. This can be a serious
contributor to depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and other mental health
struggles. If your loved one has expressed that personal care is becoming more
difficult, you could offer support by assisting them when needed.



	<h5>7. Watch for Signs of Depression</h5>


	Unmet emotional needs could lead to depression and other mental and emotional
health problems. 
. The following are some of the most common signs of depression in older adults:



	<p><li>Low mood and low self-esteem </li>
	<li>Withdrawing from family and friends </li>
	<li>Sleeping more than usual</li>
 <li>Lack of interest in preferred hobbies</li>
  <li>Speaking frequently about death,
dying, or suicide</li><p>

	

The concept of mindfulness is simple. This ancient practice is
about being completely aware of what’s happening in the present—of all that’s going on
inside and all that’s happening around you. It means not living your life on
“autopilot.” Becoming a more mindful person requires commitment and practice. Here are
some tips to help you get started.

	
  <p>Depression is the most prevalent
mental health problem among older adults. It is associated with distress and suffering
which can lead to impairments in physical, mental, and social functioning. f you care
for an aging loved one, you probably spend a good deal of time thinking about their
physical health needs. You might drive them to medical appointments, make sure they’re
getting the right nutrition, and put measures in place to reduce their pain or
discomfort. All of these actions are incredibly helpful for older adults, but it’s
also important to consider your loved one’s emotional needs.</p>

	<p>We may wrongly assume that increased feelings of sadness, loneliness and isolation
are normal emotional changes that occur in older age. 

	

	While it has its challenges, aging can bring positive feelings through supporting
healthy lifestyles, maintaining long relationships with friends and growing families,
and making new friends.

	
	<h5>Growing Isolation and Loneliness of Seniors </h5>
	Some seniors feel more isolated and
alone as they grow older,  These feelings are not normal to seniors or any age group for that matter.

	Because we’re social creatures by nature, pandemic lockdowns and social distancing
among other things can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, according a
report by the National Institutes of Health. The study didn’t factor in the occurrence
of these conditions related to age.

	
	  <h5>Depression Is Not a Normal Part of Aging </h5>
	  <p>No age group is immune from experiencing depression, but it is not a
normal occurrence for anyone, including seniors, the NIH says. Nor is loneliness only
experienced by those advancing in age.

	In fact, younger adults are more frequently diagnosed with depression than older
people, according to a National Institute of Mental Health article on seniors and
depression.

	Depression and emotional signs of stress in older people may be harder to detect.
One reason is that seniors tend  to be more reluctant to share concerns that they are
feeling depressed.

	Sadness is not the main symptom of older adults suffering from depression, which
can lead to frequent misdiagnosis, according to NIMH. </p>
