  <H1> Water </H1>

  <li>Every cell, tissue and organ in your body needs water to work properly.</li>
  Forexample, water:

  <li>Gets rid of wastes through urination, perspiration and bowel movements </li>
  <li>Keeps your temperature normal</li>
  <li> Lubricates and cushions joints</li>
  <li> Protects sensitive tissues </li>
  <li> carrying nutrients and oxygen to your cells</li>
  <li> flushing bacteria from your bladder
  <li>aiding digestion</li>
  <li>preventing constipation</li>
  <li>normalizing blood pressure</li>
  <li>maintaining electrolyte
    (sodium) balance.</li>

  Lack of
  water can lead to dehydration — a condition that occurs when you don't have enough
  water in your body to carry out normal functions. Even mild dehydration can drain your
  energy and make you tired.
  <li>How much water do you need?</li>

  \Every day you lose water through your breath,
  perspiration, urine and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you must
  replenish its water supply by consuming beverages and foods that contain water.

  So how much fluid does the average, healthy adult living in a temperate climate
  need? The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined
  that an adequate daily fluid intake is:

  <li>About 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men</li>
  <li>About 11.5 cups (2.7 liters)
    of fluids a day for women</li> These recommendations cover fluids from water, other
  beverages and food. About 20% of daily fluid intake usually comes from food and the
  rest from drinks.That might mean you daily need of plain water depends on other fluid
  sources such as coffee, tea, juice, fruits, and vegetables.


  <p>What about the advice to drink 8 glasses a day? You've probably heard the advice
    to drink eight glasses of water a day. That's easy to remember, and it's a reasonable
    goal.</p>

  <p>Most healthy people can stay hydrated by drinking water and other fluids whenever
    they feel thirsty. For some people, fewer than eight glasses a day might be enough.
    But other people might need more.</p>


  You might need to modify your total fluid intake based on several factors:

  <p>Exercise. If you do any activity that makes you sweat, you need to drink extra
    water to cover the fluid loss. It's important to drink water before, during and after
    a workout. </p>
  <p>Environment. Hot or humid weather can make you sweat and requires
    additional fluid. Dehydration also can occur at high altitudes. </p>

  <p>Overall health. Your
    body loses fluids when you have a fever, vomiting or diarrhea. Drink more water or
    follow a doctor's recommendation to drink oral rehydration solutions. Other conditions
    that might require increased fluid intake include bladder infections and urinary tract
    stones.</p>
  <p>
  <h6>Is water the only option for staying
    hydrated?</h6> No. You don't need to rely only on water to meet your fluid needs. What you
  eat also provides a significant portion. For example, many fruits and vegetables, such
  as watermelon and spinach, are almost 100% water by weight.

  In addition, beverages such as milk, juice and herbal teas are composed mostly of
  water. Even caffeinated drinks — such as coffee and soda — can contribute to your
  daily water intake. But go easy on sugar-sweetened drinks. Regular soda, energy or
  sports drinks, and other sweet drinks usually contain a lot of added sugar, which may
  provide more calories than needed.</p>
  <p>
    <li>How do I know if I'm drinking enough? </li>Your fluid intake is probably adequate if:

    <li>You rarely feel thirsty </li>
    <li>Your urine is colorless or light yellow</li> Your doctor or
    dietitian can help you determine the amount of water that's right for you every day.
  </p>

  To prevent dehydration and make sure your body has the fluids it needs, make water
  your beverage of choice. It's a good idea to drink a glass of water:

  <li>With each meal and between meals </li>
  <li>Before, during and after exercise</li>
  <li>If you feel
    thirsty</li>

  <p> Should I worry about drinking too much water Drinking too much water is rarely
    a problem for healthy, well-nourished adults. Athletes occasionally may drink too much
    water in an attempt to prevent dehydration during long or intense exercise. When you
    drink too much water, your kidneys can't get rid of the excess water. The sodium
    content of your blood becomes diluted. This is called hyponatremia and it can be
    life-threatening.</p>

  <p>And it's a myth that caffeinated beverages or those containing alcohol are
    dehydrating because they make you urinate. They do, but over the course of the day,
    the water from these beverages still leads to a net positive contribution to total
    fluid consumption.
  <p>

  <p>Of course, there are many reasons why water is still the better choice. Remember,
    sugary drinks can lead to weight gain and inflammation, which can increase your risk
    for developing diseases such as diabetes. Too much caffeine can give you the jitters
    or keep you from sleeping. And alcohol intake should be limited to one drink per day
    for women, and one to two drinks per day for men.
