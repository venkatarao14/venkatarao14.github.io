  <h2>Weather and seasonal effects</h2>
  <div> Important things to keep in mind: </div>
  <p> Weather plays a significant role in everyone’s life, but it’s
    especially important to consider its impact on seniors. Our
    bodies become less capable of adjusting to temperature changes
    and other weather conditions as we age. That means seniors are
    more vulnerable to health issues caused by shifts in weather.
    From extreme temperatures to poor air quality, it’s essential to
    understand how weather impacts senior health. </P>
  <li>Temperature
    Extremes and Seniors Health</li>

  <p> One of the most significant ways weather impacts senior
    health is through extreme temperatures. Seniors are more sensitive to
    both hot and cold conditions. High temperatures can cause heat
    exhaustion or heat stroke during the summer. On the flip side,
    extremely cold temperatures can lead to hypothermia. Seniors have a
    harder time regulating their body temperature, so staying indoors
    during heatwaves or freezing weather is vital. Having access to
    climate-controlled spaces is key.</p>

  <li> Humidity and Respiratory health.</li>
  <p>
    Humidity can significantly impact a senior’s ability to breathe comfortably.
    High humidity
    Highh humidity levels make it harder for the body to cool down. This can exacerbate
    conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    (COPD). When the air is too humid, seniors may find it more difficult
    to breathe, which increases the risk of dehydration. Conversely, low
    humidity can cause dry skin, respiratory issues, and dehydration.
    Maintaining balanced indoor air moisture levels is important for
    senior health.
